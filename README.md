# Graph Analysis of Facebook Pages
Here is a project where I was required to find a dataset of networks, formulate a graph-related question, and code the graph-related question in Rust. 

The Facebook dataset was found on https://snap.stanford.edu/data/gemsec-Facebook.html and consisted of 13,866 nodes representing a unique page. The edges represented mutual likes among the pages.

Inside this repo you will find the data file used for analysis, the Rust file to solve the degree distribution of the dataset, and the written report describing my findings.
